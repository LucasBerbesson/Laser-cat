## Laser Tower for the CAT 
Pseudo-randomly moves a servo tower (on X and Y axis) and lights up a laser.

Watch it working : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHIrxL0giJQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHIrxL0giJQ)


## Set up
x_servo is attached to pin 9 (and +5V and GND) and moves in the X plan.

y_servo is attached to pin 6 (and +5V and GND) and moves in the Y plan.

Laser is attached to pin 13 (and GND).

SoundSensor attached to A0

Download the .ino file, open it inside the arduino software and send it to your arduino. 

## How it works : 
The program randomly choose a new position for the laser inside a square you can define in the variables.
It checks the new position is different from the old one of at least "minimal_movement".
It moves the tower to the new position and stays still for a time between min_freeze and max_freeze 
(this aims to reproduce the behaviour of an insect landing somewhere for a bit and then flying off, 
that's the variable you need to increase if your cat is fat...).
And starts the process over and over again.

## Note:
The Laser_cat_mod.ino is mostly the same code but with the laser beint intermittently switched on/off every half second. This decreases the risk that your cat will get a laser beam shined in their eye.
